## Introduction ☕

#### ꩜ JShell
The **Java Shell tool (JShell)** is an interactive tool for learning the Java programming language and prototyping Java code. It was introduced in JDK 9. JShell is a **Read-Evaluate-Print Loop tool (REPL)**, which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the results. The tool is run from the command line.   

To start JShell we can write `jshell` in command prompt and to exit the shell we can use `/exit`.   

**Examples :**   
```shell
jshell> int x = 45
x ==> 45
|  created variable x : int
```
When an expression is entered that doesn't have a named variable, a **scratch variable** is created so that its value can be referenced later. The below example shows scratch values for an expression and for the results of a method.   
```shell
jshell> 2 + 2
$3 ==> 4
|  created scratch variable $3 : int

jshell> String twice(String s) {
   ...>    return s + s;
   ...> }
|  created method twice(String)

jshell> twice("Ocean")
$5 ==> "OceanOcean"
|  created scratch variable $5 : String
```
