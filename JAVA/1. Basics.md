#### ê©œ JShell
The **Java Shell tool (JShell)** is an interactive tool for learning the Java programming language and prototyping Java code. It was introduced in JDK 9. JShell is a **Read-Evaluate-Print Loop tool (REPL)**, which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the results. The tool is run from the command line.   

To start JShell we can write `jshell` in command prompt and to exit the sheel we can use `/exit`.   

**Examples :**   
```shell
jshell> int x = 45
x ==> 45
|  created variable x : int
```
