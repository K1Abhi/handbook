> **Note:** Querying **file metadata** in a stage does **not require a warehouse**, but querying **table data** in Snowflake **does require a warehouse**.

## 📥 Loading CSV into Snowflake ❄️

CSV files from your local system can be uploaded to Snowflake by first loading them into a **stage**.

### 🗂️ Types of Stages

1. **Internal Stages**:
   - **Named Stage**: Created explicitly by the user (`CREATE STAGE mystage`)
   - **User Stage**: Automatically created for each Snowflake user
   - **Table Stage**: Associated with each table

2. **External Stages**:
   - Integration with cloud storage like **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, or **Azure Blob Storage**

### 📦 Example: Using an Internal Stage

```sql
-- Create a named internal stage
CREATE STAGE mystage;

-- List files uploaded to the stage
LIST @mystage;
