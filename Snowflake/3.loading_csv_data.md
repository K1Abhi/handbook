Note: when quering metadata warehouse is not needed but when we query the table data warehouse is needed.


## Loading CSV into Snowflake ❄️

Files in local can be uploaded into snowflake by loading them into stage.
### Types of Stage
1. **Internal Stage**: Named Stage, User Stage (amutomatically created for users), Table stages ( associated with each table )
2. **External Stage**: AWS S3, GCP Bucket etc.

#### Internal Stage 

```SQL
CREATE STAGE mystage;

-- listing files in a named stage
LIST @mystage; 
```
