## Snowpark 

### What is Snowpark?
Snowpark is a client-side library, not a server-side engine or tool. It allows you to write code (especially in Python, Java, or Scala) that executes within Snowflake, close to the data.   
The main goal is to push business logic to where the data lives—inside Snowflake’s compute infrastructure—so you don’t need to move large amounts of data back and forth between client and server.

### Why is there a push for Snowpark?
- Snowflake initially supported stored procedures (SPs) with:
  - Only single SQL statements
  - And JavaScript (which was clunky for complex pipelines)
- Then came Snowflake Scripting (like PL/SQL or T-SQL), which allowed procedural SQL blocks.
- Now, Snowpark takes it a step further:
  - Let you define complex business logic (e.g., data transformations) using DataFrame APIs and Python functions
  - All while keeping the processing inside Snowflake, without pulling the data to a client

### Client vs. Server Execution
- Traditionally, logic would run on your local machine or cloud VM, connecting to Snowflake and pulling data to process.
- With Snowpark, you instead send your logic to Snowflake, and it’s executed on the same infrastructure where your data lives.
- This reduces latency, cost, and bandwidth usage.
