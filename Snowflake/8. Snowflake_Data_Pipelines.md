## ❄️ Snowflake Data Pipelines 

### Scenario 1: Real-Time Table Syncing via Change Data Capture (CDC)

#### Use Case
- A `customers` table is owned by an external department.
- Need to maintain an up-to-date copy in our Snowflake database.
- Sync should reflect all changes in **near real-time**.

#### Solution Overview
- Use **Change Data Capture (CDC)** to handle incremental updates.

#### Methods for Implementing CDC in Snowflake
1. **MERGE Statement**
   - SQL command to upsert records into a target table.
2. **Change Tracking**
   - Allows tracking changes on a table without capturing the actual data.
3. **Streams and Tasks**
   - Earlier method to automate CDC workflows.
4. **Dynamic Tables**
   - New and simplified approach to manage incremental data changes.

### Scenario 2: Automated CSV Ingestion via Snowpipe

#### Use Case
- New employee records are added using CSV files dropped into an **Amazon S3 bucket**.
- Only insertions are allowed (no updates or deletions).

#### Solution Overview
- Use **Snowpipe** to automate CSV ingestion.

#### Components Involved
- **External Stage**: Connects Snowflake to the S3 bucket.
- **Snowpipe**: Automates continuous data loading from S3 into Snowflake.

### Summary

| Requirement                       | Solution                             |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sync external table in real-time  | Change Data Capture (CDC)            |
| Handle inserts via CSV in S3      | Snowpipe + External Stage (S3)       |

> These approaches help build robust, scalable, and near real-time data pipelines in Snowflake.

## Batch & Stream Data Transfer

## Overview

How to implement **batch and streaming data ingestion** from a transactional source system (typically OLTP) into Snowflake using **Change Data Capture (CDC)**.
## Typical Pipeline Flow

1. **Initial Full Batch Transfer**
   - One-time full data load from the source database to Snowflake.
   - May take significant time depending on table size.

2. **Enable CDC on Source Database**
   - Supported by databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SAP, etc.
   - Captures changes (INSERTs, UPDATEs, DELETEs) in a **CDC log**.

3. **Periodic CDC Log Transfer**
   - A data transfer tool (e.g., **Fivetran, Airbyte, Stitch**) reads CDC logs.
   - These are loaded into a **stage table** in Snowflake.
   - Each record reflects an incremental change.
## Example Workflow
- **Stage Table** receives CDC records:
  - **Inserts**: New records.
  - **Updates**: Shown as DELETE of old + INSERT of new.
  - **Deletes**: Marked with a `DEL` flag.

---
### Illustration Example:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/996a54c4-e3f7-44e2-abc2-2787aed81253)
- Stage Table:
  - Initial: 3 inserts (new records) 1st operation.
  - Next: 2 more rows (1 update to name, 1 delete marked via flag).
---

## Applying Changes in Snowflake

The core challenge: **How to reflect stage table changes into the target snapshot table.**

### CDC Methods in Snowflake:

1. **Manual Merge Statements**
   - Use a **stored procedure** to encapsulate a `MERGE` statement.
   - Applies changes from stage to target table.

2. **Change Tracking**
   - Enables tracking of changes at the table level.
   - Captures changes to be applied elsewhere.

3. **Streams and Tasks** *(Older Approach)*
   - **Stream** detects changes.
   - **Task** runs periodically and checks if `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA`.
   - If changes exist, runs `MERGE` using metadata fields like `METADATA$ACTION`.

4. **Dynamic Tables** *(Modern & Recommended)*
   - Replaces streams and tasks.
   - Automatically manages incremental changes and updates to the target table.

## Summary Table

| Step                        | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Initial Batch Load          | One-time full data transfer |
| CDC Log Capture             | Source DB logs changes |
| CDC Log Ingestion           | Transfer tools push changes to Snowflake |
| Change Application Methods  | Manual Merge, Change Tracking, Streams & Tasks, Dynamic Tables |

> Modern Snowflake CDC is best implemented using **Dynamic Tables** for simplicity and automation.
