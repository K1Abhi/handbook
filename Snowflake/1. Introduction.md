# INTRODUCTION 
## What is a Virtual Warehouse?
- Think of it as our **“compute engine”—no queries can run without it**.
- Snowflake automatically creates one warehouse for new users:
  - Size: X-Small
  - State: Initially suspended
- You’ll use this default warehouse for all your query executions.

## Cost and Sizing of Warehouses

- **X-Small** is the **smallest and cheapest** option:
  - Consumes 1 credit/hour (on a running basis).
  - Costs vary based on your edition and cloud provider:
      - **Enterprise Edition on AWS:** ~$3 per credit
      - **Standard Edition:** ~$2 per credit
- **Larger warehouse sizes** follow powers of two (2, 4, 8 nodes, etc.), using more credits.

### How Snowflake Pricing Works
- Snowflake charges per credit for compute, not per second or per minute:
  - e.g., X-Small (1 node) = 1 credit/hour
- **Your bill = warehouse size × runtime (in hours) × credit cost**
- Additional features like **Time Travel** or **Multi-Cluster** are hard to price directly, so compute usage is Snowflake’s main monetization model.
