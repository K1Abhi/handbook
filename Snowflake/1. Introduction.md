# INTRODUCTION 
## What is a Virtual Warehouse?
- Think of it as our **“compute engine”—no queries can run without it**.
- Snowflake automatically creates one warehouse for new users:
  - Size: X-Small
  - State: Initially suspended
- You’ll use this default warehouse for all your query executions.
