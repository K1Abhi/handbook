## 🎯 Objectives of This Section
This first section of the Pandas course focuses on building a strong foundation on **Series**, which is one of the core data structures in the Pandas library.

### 🗂️ Topics Covered
#### Part 1: Understanding Series 
- **Definition of a Series:**
  - A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floats, Python objects, etc.).
  - Key component in the Pandas library
- **Series Attributes and Methods:**
  - Built-in properties and functions to manipulate Series.
#### Part 2: Data Selection in Series (Series Indexing)
- **Purpose:**
  - Learn how to select, index, or extract data from a Series.
- **Terminologies Used:**
  - Series Indexing
  - Data Selection
  - Data Extraction
> 💡 Note: Though different terms may be used, the core idea remains the same — retrieving specific values or subsets from a Series.

### ❗ Why It Matters
The techniques learned here form the foundation for working with Pandas effectively.   
Data selection methods and general Pandas principles from this section will extend to the entire library, making this a crucial starting point.

## ⩩ What is a Series? 
#### 🧠 Definition
A **Series** in Pandas is:
- A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- Or more intuitively: a sequence of values with associated labels (also called the index).

#### Creating a Series in Pandas
We can create a Series from a basic Python list using the `Series` constructor from the `pandas` module.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Python list
students = ["Andrew", "Free", "Konica"]

# Creating a Series from the list
pd.Series(students)
```
