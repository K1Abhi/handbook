## 🎯 Objectives of This Section
This first section of the Pandas course focuses on building a strong foundation on **Series**, which is one of the core data structures in the Pandas library.

### 🗂️ Topics Covered
#### Part 1: Understanding Series 
- **Definition of a Series:**
  - A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floats, Python objects, etc.).
  - Key component in the Pandas library
- **Series Attributes and Methods:**
  - Built-in properties and functions to manipulate Series.
#### Part 2: Data Selection in Series (Series Indexing)
- **Purpose:**
  - Learn how to select, index, or extract data from a Series.
- **Terminologies Used:**
  - Series Indexing
  - Data Selection
  - Data Extraction
> 💡 Note: Though different terms may be used, the core idea remains the same — retrieving specific values or subsets from a Series.

### ❗ Why It Matters
The techniques learned here form the foundation for working with Pandas effectively.   
Data selection methods and general Pandas principles from this section will extend to the entire library, making this a crucial starting point.

## ⩩ What is a Series? 
### Definition
A **Series** in Pandas is:
- A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
- Or more intuitively: a sequence of values with associated labels (also called the index).

### Creating a Series in Pandas
We can create a Series from a basic Python list using the `Series` constructor from the `pandas` module.
```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Python list
students = ["Andrew", "Free", "Konica"]

# Creating a Series from the list
pd.Series(students)
```
**Output:**

This produces a Series where:
- The values come from the list.
- The labels (indexes) are automatically assigned as integers starting from `0`.

### Series with Different Data Types
Pandas Series can hold various types of data, and Pandas will automatically infer the appropriate data type.
**Example 1: Integer Series**
```python
ages = [22, 24, 23]
pd.Series(ages)
```
**Output**

**Example 2: Float Series**
```python
heights = [167.4, 173.2, 190.0]
pd.Series(heights)
```
**Note:** We didn't specify the data type, but Pandas will infer those automatically:
- int64 for integers
- float64 for decimals
  
**Example 3: Mixed Data Types in Series**
Unlike NumPy arrays, **Pandas Series can contain mixed data types**.
```python
mixed = [True, "Okay", {"mood": "100%"}]
pd.Series(mixed)
```
> This is valid in Pandas. Not allowed in NumPy, which requires homogeneous types.

### Numpy Array v/s Pandas Series 

| Feature             | NumPy Array     | Pandas Series                |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Data type           | Homogeneous     | Heterogeneous                |
| Labeling (Indexing) | Positional only | Supports custom labels       |
| Built-in Metadata   | No              | Yes (`dtype`, `index`, etc.) |

### 📝 Summary ── .✦── .✦── .✦── .✦── .✦
- A Pandas Series is a flexible, one-dimensional structure ideal for labeled data.
- You can store integers, floats, strings, booleans, dictionaries, and even a mix of them.
- Pandas handles type inference automatically.
- Series can be much more powerful than NumPy arrays due to their flexibility and indexing.
